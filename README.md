## This extension has been merged into the main DSharpPlus library. This repository will no longer be maintained and further development will continue on the main repository. The nuget package will still be available if you wish to use it with the stable version (1.7.6 works with stable version 4.1.0), but if you're using the nightlies use the official DSharpPlus.SlashCommands package from now on. Thanks for all the feedback and support, it's been a (mostly) fun ride.
